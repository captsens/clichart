NOTE - 2020
===============

* Minor changes to get this working with Python3 (still very rough)
* Note that now builds a Wheel, so have to install using:

    pip3 install build/egg/dist/clichart-0.6.0a1-py3-none-any.whl


1. Introduction
===============
clichart is a tool for quick visualisation of tabular data, by generating and
displaying charts.  It was originally developed for interactive charting of data
from server log files, but can also be called from scripts to generate and save
charts as JPEG or PNG images.  Input data can be comma- or whitespace-separated,
and can come from a file or be piped in.


2. Installation
===============
See docs/text/installation.rst or docs/html/installation.html.


3. Documentation

guide (docs/text/quickstart.rst or docs/html/quickstart.html) is a good jumping-off
point.
