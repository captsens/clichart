Installing CLIChart
=====================

Introduction
============

This page is yet to be written properly.  So the short form is:

 1. Make sure you have Java installed

    * At least Java 1.5 (aka Java 5) is required
    * Java 1.6 (aka Java 6) is recommended

 2. Make sure you have `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ installed.  Any version from 2.4 on
    should be fine, but the lastest versions tend to be faster (tested with 2.7)
 3. Extract the CLIChart zip file to a suitable directory
 4. If you want the tools to be installed in your path (recommended):

    * Install `easy_install in the setuptools modele <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
    * Use ``easy_install clichart-x.y.z.egg`` to install (insert your version number)

        + Note that on Linux you'll have to be root (or use sudo)

Test your installation by typing ``clichart -h`` at a command prompt - this should give you
the help screen.

TODO - expand.
