Installing CLIChart
=====================

Introduction
============

This page is yet to be written properly.  So the short form is:

 1. Make sure you have Java installed

    * At least Java 8 is required
    * Java 11+ is recommended

 2. Make sure you have `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ installed.  Any version from 3.8 on
    should be fine, but the lastest versions tend to be faster
 3. Extract the CLIChart zip file to a suitable directory
 4. Use ``pip3 install clichart-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`` to install (insert your version number)

    * This will typically make all the CLIChart scripts available on your path
    * On Windows, this will likely require administrator privileges
    * On Linux, you must do this as root, or using ``sudo`` to get the required privileges
    * On Mac, you typically do this without elevated privileges, and CLIChart is installed under your user account.
      In that case, you may be prompted to add the ``bin`` directory to your path.

Test your installation by typing ``clichart -h`` at a command prompt - this should give you
the help screen.

TODO - expand.
