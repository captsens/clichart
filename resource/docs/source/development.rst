WIP

- Github
- Sourceforge (?)
- Follow DistChecklist.txt

Particular notes:

- bin/checkDevPrereqs.py
- build.properties for Java
- Running unit tests individually

  * Just execute the script.  Can also pass in class name or class name.method name (example todo)

- Clichart is Java (executed by Python script)
- All other tools are python
- Currently using Maven for Java, and ad hoc scripts for all other tasks
- Packaging/install using easy_install from python setuptools
- Sphinx, and automatic update in readthedocs?
