=========================================
Checklist prior to shipping a new version
=========================================

0. Check prerequisites
----------------------

Check off the tools listed in /resource/docs/source/development.rst.
    

1. Run all unit tests, and check code coverage
----------------------------------------------

    gradle coverage
    open build/reports/javaCoverage/index.html
    open build/reports/pythonCoverage/index.html

- Check that no tests failed
- Check that the unit test coverage looks OK


2. Update version number
------------------------

Required in 4 places:

- build.gradle.
- setup.py (will be done automatically during packaging, just in case)
- resource/docs/source/conf.py (build will fail if not in sync)
- CHANGES file.


3. Check CHANGES and TODO
-------------------------

- Ensure that all changes are recorded in ``CHANGES.rst``, and removed from TODO.
- Ensure that the version number and release date are correct in CHANGES.


4. Do a clean distribution build
--------------------------------

    gradle clean dist


5. Check Documentation
----------------------

    open resource/docs/build/html/index.html
    open build/docs/javadoc/index.html

Review, and ensure that there are no errors building, and no changes necessary.  Note that
the build script will generate new small (thumbnail) images of any PNG file that has
been modified - check for any changes afterwards.

Check all links (should be warnings about no robots for forums):

    linkchecker resource/docs/build/html/index.html

To change the overview.svg diagram, use Inkscape, and:

    - Export Bitmap
    - Select 'Drawing' tab page
    - Save as overview.png, at about 90dpi


6. Check in git for modifications
----------------------------------------

    git status
    git commit -a

NOTE: If you're on a branch, make sure you merge the branch back to master:

    git branch              # to get the branch name
    git checkout master
    git merge the-branch-name


7. Test the build
-----------------

    gradle installForTest
    . build/install-test/virtualenv/bin/activate
    bin/testInstall.py
    deactivate

Close the interactive charts as they come up.  Expect lots of OKs and some echos on the
terminal, plus some stderr: echos.

Charts will be saved under build/install-test/output.  You should now eyeball the charts
produced, using an appropriate image viewer, e.g.

    gwenview build/install-test/output    # or gqview, or ...

Also, check the doco:

    open build/install-test/clichart-0.5.9/docs/html/index.html
    open build/install-test/clichart-0.5.9/docs/javadoc/index.html



8. Tag in Git, and push source to Github
-----------------------------------------

    git tag 0.5.9
    git push -u --tags origin master


9. Create release in Github
----------------------------

- Go to Release tab
- Click Draft a new release
- Select tag
- Enter most recent part of changelog, and check that it previews OK
- Click to upload the zip file (from target/package)


10. Check the docs on readthedocs.org
-------------------------------------

Should be rebuilt automatically based on webhook from github.
