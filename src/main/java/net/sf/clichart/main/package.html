This package contains classes used to generate charts from the command-line, whether
interactively (with the chart displayed in a GUI window) or autmatically (with the
chart saved to a nominated file).

<p>The {@link net.sf.clichart.main.DefaultChartGenerator} class is also the one you want if you're using
clichart as a library.
